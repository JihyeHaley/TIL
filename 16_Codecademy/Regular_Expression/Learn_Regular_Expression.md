 

## Literals

The simplest text we can match with regular expressions are ***literals\***. This is where our regular expression contains the exact text that we want to match. The regex `a`, for example, will match the text `a`, and the regex `bananas` will match the text `bananas`.

We can additionally match just part of a piece of text. Perhaps we are searching a document to see if the word `monkey` occurs, since we love monkeys. We could use the regex `monkey` to match `monkey` in the piece of text `The monkeys like to eat bananas.`.

Not only are we able to match alphabetical characters — digits work as well! The regex `3` will match the `3` in the piece of text `34`, and the regex `5 gibbons` will completely match the text `5 gibbons`!

Regular expressions operate by moving character by character, from left to right, through a piece of text. When the regular expression finds a character that matches the first piece of the expression, it looks to find a continuous sequence of matching characters.







## Alternation

Do you love baboons and gorillas? You can find either of them with the same regular expression using ***alternation!\*** Alternation, performed in regular expressions with the pipe symbol, `|`, allows us to match either the characters preceding the `|` OR the characters after the `|`. The regex `baboons|gorillas` will match `baboons` in the text `I love baboons`, but will also match `gorillas` in the text `I love gorillas`.

Are you thinking about how to match the whole piece of text `I love baboons` or `I love gorillas`? We will get to that later on!





## Character Sets

Spelling tests may seem like a distant memory from grade school, but we ultimately take them every day while typing. It’s easy to make mistakes on commonly misspelled words like `consensus`, and on top of that, there are sometimes alternate spellings for the same word.

***Character sets\***, denoted by a pair of brackets `[]`, let us match one character from a series of characters, allowing for matches with incorrect or different spellings.

The regex `con[sc]en[sc]us` will match `consensus`, the correct spelling of the word, but also match the following three incorrect spellings: `concensus`, `consencus`, and `concencus`. The letters inside the first brackets, `s` and `c`, are the different possibilities for the character that comes after `con` and before `en`. Similarly for the second brackets, `s` and `c` are the different character possibilities to come after `en` and before `us`.

Thus the regex `[cat]` will match the characters `c`, `a`, *or* `t`, but not the text `cat`.

The beauty of character sets (and alternation) is that they allow our regular expressions to become more flexible and less rigid than by just matching with literals!

We can make our character sets even more powerful with the help of the caret `^` symbol. Placed at the front of a character set, the `^` negates the set, matching any character that is *not* stated. These are called *negated character sets*. Thus the regex `[^cat]` will match any character that is not `c`, `a`, *or* `t`, and would completely match each character `d`, `o` *or* `g`.

Do we have a consensus that regular expressions are pretty cool?****

## Wild for Wildcards

Sometimes we don’t care exactly WHAT characters are in a text, just that there are SOME characters. Enter the wildcard `.`! ***Wildcards\*** will match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace) in a piece of text. They are useful when we do not care about the specific value of a character, but only that a character exists!

Let’s say we want to match any 9-character piece of text. The regex `.........` will completely match `orangutan` and `marsupial`! Similarly, the regex `I ate . bananas` will completely match both `I ate 3 bananas` and `I ate 8 bananas`!

What happens if we want to match an actual period, `.`? We can use the escape character, `\`, to escape the wildcard functionality of the `.` and match an actual period. The regex `Howler monkeys are really lazy\.` will completely match the text `Howler monkeys are really lazy.`.

## Ranges

Character sets are great, but their true power isn’t realized without ranges. ***Ranges\*** allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match without having to type out each individual character. The regex `[abc]`, which would match any character `a`, `b`, *or* `c`, is equivalent to regex range `[a-c]`. The `-` character allows us to specify that we are interested in matching a range of characters.

The regex `I adopted [2-9] [b-h]ats` will match the text `I adopted 4 bats` as well as `I adopted 8 cats` and even `I adopted 5 hats`.

With ranges we can match any single capital letter with the regex `[A-Z]`, lowercase letter with the regex `[a-z]`, any digit with the regex `[0-9]`. We can even have multiple ranges in the same character set! To match any single capital *or* lowercase alphabetical character, we can use the regex `[A-Za-z]`.

Remember, within any character set `[]` we only match *one* character.

```python
[c-e][l-u][b-k]
```





## Shorthand Character Classes

While character ranges are extremely useful, they can be cumbersome to write out every single time you want to match common ranges such as those that designate alphabetical characters or digits. To alleviate this pain, there are ***shorthand character classes\*** that represent common ranges, and they make writing regular expressions much simpler. These shorthand classes include:

- `\w`: the “word character” class represents the regex range `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, and it matches a single uppercase character, lowercase character, digit or underscore
- `\d`: the “digit character” class represents the regex range `[0-9]`, and it matches a single digit character
- `\s`: the “whitespace character” class represents the regex range `[ \t\r\n\f\v]`, matching a single space, tab, carriage return, line break, form feed, or vertical tab

For example, the regex `\d\s\w\w\w\w\w\w\w` matches a digit character, followed by a whitespace character, followed by 7 word characters. Thus the regex completely matches the text `3 monkeys`.

In addition to the shorthand character classes `\w`, `\d`, and `\s`, we also have access to the *negated shorthand character classes*! These shorthands will match any character that is NOT in the regular shorthand classes. These negated shorthand classes include:

- `\W`: the “non-word character” class represents the regex range `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\w`
- `\D`: the “non-digit character” class represents the regex range `[^0-9]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\d`
- `\S`: the “non-whitespace character” class represents the regex range `[^ \t\r\n\f\v]`, matching any character that is not included in the range represented by `\s`





## Grouping

Remember when we were in love with baboons and gorillas a few exercises ago? We were able to match either `baboons` or `gorillas` using the regex `baboons|gorillas`, taking advantage of the `|` symbol.

But what if we want to match the whole piece of text `I love baboons` and `I love gorillas` with the same regex? Your first guess might be to use the regex `I love baboons|gorillas`. This regex, while it would completely match the string `I love baboons`, would not match `I love gorillas`, and would instead match `gorillas`. This is because the `|` symbol matches the *entire* expression before or after itself.

Grouping to the rescue! ***Grouping\***, denoted with the open parenthesis `(` and the closing parenthesis `)`, lets us group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of the regex.

The regex `I love (baboons|gorillas)` will match the text `I love` and *then* match either `baboons` or `gorillas`, as the grouping limits the reach of the `|` to the text within the parentheses.

These groups are also called *capture groups*, as they have the power to select, or capture, a substring from our matched text.





## Quantifiers - Fixed

Here’s where things start to get really interesting. So far we have only matched text on a character by character basis. But instead of writing the regex `\w\w\w\w\w\w\s\w\w\w\w\w\w`, which would match 6 word characters, followed by a whitespace character, and then followed by more 6 word characters, such as in the text `rhesus monkey`, is there a better way to denote the quantity of characters we want to match?

The answer is yes, with the help of quantifiers! ***Fixed quantifiers\***, denoted with curly braces `{}`, let us indicate the exact quantity of a character we wish to match, or allow us to provide a quantity range to match on.

- `\w{3}` will match *exactly* 3 word characters
- `\w{4,7}` will match *at minimum* 4 word characters and *at maximum* 7 word characters

The regex `roa{3}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by `3` `a`s, and then the character `r`, such as in the text `roaaar`. The regex `roa{3,7}r` will match the characters `ro` followed by *at least* `3` `a`s and *at most* `7` `a`s, followed by an `r`, matching the strings `roaaar`, `roaaaaar` and `roaaaaaaar`.

An important note is that quantifiers are considered to be *greedy*. This means that they will match the greatest quantity of characters they possibly can. For example, the regex `mo{2,4}` will match the text `moooo` in the string `moooo`, and not return a match of `moo`, or `mooo`. This is because the fixed quantifier wants to match the largest number of `o`s as possible, which is `4` in the string `moooo`.





## Quantifiers - Optional

You are working on a research project that summarizes the findings of primate behavioral scientists from around the world. Of particular interest to you are the scientists’ observations of humor in chimpanzees, so you whip up some regex to find all occurrences of the word `humor` in the documents you have collected. To your dismay, your regex misses the observations of amusement written by scientists hailing from British English speaking countries, where the spelling of the word is `humour`. Optional quantifiers to the rescue!

***Optional quantifiers\***, indicated by the question mark `?`, allow us to indicate a character in a regex is optional, or can appear either `0` times or `1` time. For example, the regex `humou?r` matches the characters `humo`, then either `0` occurrences or `1` occurrence of the letter `u`, and finally the letter `r`. Note the `?` *only* applies to the character directly before it.

With all quantifiers, we can take advantage of grouping to make even more advanced regexes. The regex `The monkey ate a (rotten )?banana` will completely match both `The monkey ate a rotten banana` and `The monkey ate a banana`.

Since the `?` is a metacharacter, you need to use the escape character in your regex in order to match a question mark `?` in a piece of text. The regex `Aren't owl monkeys beautiful\?` will thus completely match the text `Aren't owl monkeys beautiful?`.

```python
\d (ducks? for adoption)\?
# Possible Solution
# Regex: \d ducks? for adoption\?
```







## Quantifiers - 0 or More, 1 or More

In 1951, mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene developed a system to match patterns in written language with mathematical notation. This notation is now known as regular expressions!

In his honor, the next piece of regular expressions syntax we will learn is known as the Kleene star. The ***Kleene star\***, denoted with the asterisk `*`, is also a quantifier, and matches the preceding character `0` or more times. This means that the character doesn’t need to appear, can appear once, or can appear many many times.

The regex `meo*w` will match the characters `me`, followed by `0` or more `o`s, followed by a `w`. Thus the regex will match `mew`, `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`.

Another useful quantifier is the ***Kleene plus\***, denoted by the plus `+`, which matches the preceding character `1` or more times.

The regex `meo+w` will match the characters `me`, followed by `1` or more `o`s, followed by a `w`. Thus the regex will match `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`, but not match `mew`.

Like all the other metacharacters, in order to match the symbols `*` and `+`, you need to use the escape character in your regex. The regex `My cat is a \*` will completely match the text `My cat is a *`.

```python
hoo+t
```







## Anchors

When writing regular expressions, it’s useful to make the expression as specific as possible in order to ensure that we do not match unintended text. To aid in this mission of specificity, we can use the anchor metacharacters. The ***anchors\*** hat `^` and dollar sign `$` are used to match text at the start and the end of a string, respectively.

The regex `^Monkeys: my mortal enemy$` will completely match the text `Monkeys: my mortal enemy` but not match `Spider Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild` or `Squirrel Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild`. The `^` ensures that the matched text begins with `Monkeys`, and the `$` ensures the matched text ends with `enemy`.

Without the anchor tags, the regex `Monkeys: my mortal enemy` will match the text `Monkeys: my mortal enemy` in both `Spider Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild` and `Squirrel Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild`.

Once again, as with all other metacharacters, in order to match the symbols `^` and `$`, you need to use the escape character in your regex. The regex `My spider monkey has \$10\^6 in the bank` will completely match the text `My spider monkey has $10^6 in the bank`.

```python
^penguins are cooler than regular expressions$
```
