                    <!-- <p class="lead mb-5">Hi, I'm Jihye Oh, and people call me Haley, my middle name. I've officially gotten permission from Graduate School of Communication at Yonsei University. Currently, i am studying to become front & back end developer who can handle big data.

                        I studied <a class="font-weight-bold font-italic">East Asian International Studies(EIC)</a>. As having  played the piano for 13 years before entering into College, I was good at working in arts by using <a class ="font-weight-bold font-italic">Photoshop, Primeire Pro and Illustrator</a>. 
                        
                        In studying, I thought if I can use code and make sometihng through programming, I can show the more things of my creativity, and it would be my own special skills. I was so excited since it makes me find something that i want to learn and become.
                        
                        I decided to study <a calss="font-weight-bold font-italic">computer programming</a>. Passion in learning computer programming led me to take course of "Introduction to Software programming and Python" at school and apply to many events held by Samsung SDS and Electronics, such as <a class="font-weight-bold font-italic">IT mentoring and Bixby Conference.</a>
                        
                        Thanks to my effort, before graduation, I was picked to take course of <a class="font-weight-bold font-italic">"Bigdata Platform using Open API"</a> among hundred of applicants, which is based on Web and Bigdata Analysis held by Samsung SDS Multicampus. I have been learning  <a class="font-weight-bold font-italic"> Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP, Spring MVC, D3, SVG, My Batis, Leaflet, Linux, Hadoop, Spark, Scala, Python, R</a>.
                    
                        I have experiences of leading Web Projects (5 times). Most of my work is in charging of <a class="font-weight-bold font-italic">"Front-end, Back-end, DB using R"</a>. 

                        At the beginning of projects, we had difficulty in making all the layouts with our CSS skills, but kept trying to use the tags and figured out by using <a class="font-weight-bold font-italic">Bootstrap</a>. By using this tool, thankfly, all of us are familiar with handling tools and primary layouts. 
                        
                        After that, whenever in projects, I am not afraid of making logos with SVGs and creating contents. With some experience, my team applied to <a class="font-weight-bold font-italic">"K-startup" and "정주영창업경진대회"</a> whose idea is based on using Web programming.
                        
                        Like this, I keep going on my goal and find out what kind of things I need to or can do. For 5 months, I have focused on learning programming and participating in Startup Competition. Not only for people becoming to run own business but also planning and studying was it great chance to challenge.
                        
                        The more I am studying, I feel lacks of my knowledges and the eager of learning leads me to apply to Graduate School of Design-Intelligence at Yonsie University. I am so excited and hope my passion is well received to the professors in the course of picking like document, interview. </p>

                                        Japanese, Chinese and also English. I was the only one and youngest who is able to
                                        communicate with various languages at the store, and even since the store was
                                        located at Hongik University which is the most famous traveling spot in Seoul, South
                                        Korea. Although it makes me work harder than any other franchise stores, I was lucky
                                        to have much opportunity to talk with a variety kind of people from all around the
                                        world. It gave me the strong speaking ability and an ability to react quickly.<br>
                                        ▪︎ Coworkers are calling me “the most suitable worker at this neighborhood.”<br>
                                        ▪︎ I have big smile which is my strength. it was not difficult for me to have deep or
                                        small talk between customer and my position. Thanks to my reacting, I have gotten
                                        ranking 4th and 14th on the Partner Competition. They all happened only during a
                                        month. Some of customers were coming to meet me. My service were marked as the
                                        best at the zone where I worked so I have an opportunity to work at support center.<br>
                                        ▪︎ Through my own experience at Starbucks retail shop, I can get powered up every
                                        moment. By talking with many music, art college students, I can re-awake my passion
                                        in studying arts which was my main major before entering into college. After that, I
                                        am studying both software programming and designing. My passion leads me to do
                                        my best at everywhere such as working or studying.

                                        In Economic and Business department, I was only one who can use HTML and CSS
                                        and JavaScript. I volunteered to become a student officer also including during winter

                                        ▪︎ It was not easy at first, but time goes by, I can raise my ability like how to deal with

                                        ▪︎ I coached professors from Korean Literature because they needed scores in order
                                        to teach the courses abroad. I was suitable student instructor since I have been
                                        studying English only in Korea for 20 years. They would like to get some tips how to
                                        study English in Korea as old people who did not have to learn how to speak and write
                                        English when they are in young.<br>
                                        ▪︎ It was not easy, but they were so enthusiastic in learning. I was teaching English
                                        grammar first because without the normal form, they were not able to make their own
                                        story.<br>
                                        ▪︎ Finally, we all could go to the abroad to teach. This experience also gave me a
                                        wisdom that all people have passion to learn. So, I thought that If there is something I
                                        really want to try and achieve whenever I feel, I will go for it. And this thought led me
                                        to doing as much experience as possible in college.

                                        took course of design program at school with media and art students.<br>
                                        ▪︎ Thanks to this experience, I created formal presentation and logo form for younger
                                        generation. It was big success because I could sell the highest number of my

                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
